## Minutes of Meeting Two	Thusday 29 Sep	12:25 - 13:40

**Attendees**:	Xiaoshi Xie, Miguel Montalla,, Kenneth Rosal, Kyle Hargraves

**Agenda**: 	To ratify the project (traffic accidents in Christchurch) and propose courses of action.

These Minutes are to be read in conjunction with the notes placed in the group 'wiki' with the heading 2022-09-29 Project Prototype (posted by Xiaoshi)

1. The project, appealing to the 'CrashData.csv' file, is to be a mock report to the Christchurch City Council
that identifies collision 'hot spots' with a recommendation to reducing the prevalence of collisions at a 
given site. 

1. Referring to the suggestions by Giulio (analysis -> look and feel -> effective strategy and ethical issues)
the group discussed the excel data file that contains numerous fields relating to traffic accidents in Christchurch
city. 

2. Time is required to understand the purpose of each field in the file. Fields are to be identified (by Kyle) that
are deemed redundant so that they may be removed in order to ensure that the data sheet contains relevant fields
only. It is intended that the group members will remark on the suggestions on Tuesday 4 October.

3. In broad terms the location of each collision is to be recorded for prevalence or frequency with some arbitrary
number (perhaps 10) being identified as the (so called) 'top ten'. 

4. Again, in broad terms the data (frequency of collision) could be presented as a head map with reference to
location accompanied with a table of data corresponding to the visual effects. 

*The meeting concluded with an agreement to meet at 2pm Tuesday 4 October in room 212f in the main library.*
