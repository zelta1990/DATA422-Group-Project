## Minutes of Meeting Three	Thusday 06 Oct	12:15 - 13:45

**Attendees**:	Xiaoshi Xie, Miguel Montalla,, Kenneth Rosal, Kyle Hargraves

**Agenda**: 	To review assigned tasks from the meeting of 29 September and to assign further tasks.

1. It was agreed that accidents that were described as either fatal or serious be included in the report. There is
little that a Council can do with regard to non-injuries etc.  

2. For the interim all fields in the data file be retained with lat and long to be appended. 

3. Remove events pertaining to state highways from the main spreadsheet

4. Frequency of location will be obtained for each year (2012-22) and road or site characteristics wil be considered
for the purpose of identifying trends. This approach ought to result in a further reduction of columns at a later stage.

5. Xiaoshi, as usual, will identify activities of responsibility for this week. 

*The next meeting is to be advised but likely the 13 October during the lab session. The report is due 23 October at 13:00.*
