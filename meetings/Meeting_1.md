**Agenda**: 	To consider various topics for a project relating to Data422 and to recommend a course of action.
		
1. Various topics were discussed initially loosely based upon the attendees' project work with a recommendation that was mentioned by Xiaoshi that the project have social orientation for Christchurch city. This proposal comprised three components:
    * Bus utilisation;
    * Cycle-way utilisation;
    * Locations of traffic collisions.
with a general agreement for the 'locations of traffic collisions' within Christchurch city.

2. It became apparent, from preliminary investigations for data, that none of the topics could be considered original in any sense and moreover options (i) and (iii) have dedicated websites. A brief consultation with the tutors confirmed that the objective of the project was data wrangling and the presentation of data and not originality per se. Therefore, the independent assembly of data suffices and the various websites may serve as a useful comparison for presentation.

It was generally agreed that there are four broad divisions for the project that comprise
 * data acquisition and wrangling
 * display or visulation (e.g. heat maps)
 * basic analysis (based on presentation rather than accuracy of forecasts or analysis per se)
 * a conclusion.
       
3. Emails and WhatsApp accounts were exchanged for ease of communication along with a recommendation to use github and discord

4. A survey of data needs to be undertaken in regard to 1(iii) with a basic report for the next meeting (TBA)

5. There was the tentative suggestion that the group meet twice per week to ensure that the project is well-coordinated.
