# STAT422-Group-Project

2022-09-22 Project Launch \
We came up with several topics including bus utilization, cycleway use frequency and traffic accidents by location.
After discussion we decided to work on traffic accidents by location in Christchurch. One useful dataset we found
at NZTA website is the Crash Analysis System which contains crash data from 2000 to 2022 with details. The information
about this dataset can be found at https://www.nzta.govt.nz/safety/partners/crash-analysis-system/. We are planning to 
do some wrangling with this dataset or a subset of it to provide some insights on different factors such as weather, 
car model/age and time of the day might have on the cause of accidents.
