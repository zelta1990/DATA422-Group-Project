## Hi Everyone,

I ought to have the frequency count by location sometime this afternoon which ought to provide some detail as to
incidence. As per the comments, I think it is agreed that we will consider accidents **from 2012** and I'll trim (remove)
the (agreed?) redundant columns or fields.

The conversion from NZMG or NZTM (i.e. the current coorinate system) to GPS Lat/Long is proving to be non-trival. The 
following is a link has a formula that I will play with over the weekend. There isn't a lot on stack exchange of stack
overflow. I have asked linz.gov.nz for thier script (Javascript or whatever) but dispite their on-line converter
I'm not confident of a useful reply. 

[the formula is described here](https://www.linz.govt.nz/guidance/geodetic-system/understanding-coordinate-conversions/projection-conversions/transverse-mercator-transformation-formulae)

Cheers, Kyle.
