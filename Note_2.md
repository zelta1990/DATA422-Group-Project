Hi Guys,

Appealing to what I have discovered I have a huge .csv file on death and
accidents but nothing by locaton or time or date. We could use this
large .csv file (it has a heap of factors) but we could try something
else too.

I have in mind energy usage in NZ for which there a a fair amount of
data and this data could be compared to the EU which is busting itself
to (1) become carbon netural and (2) use public transport. Nevertheless
the percentage of energy consumed in NZ and the EU27 as a proportion of
total energy consumed is almost the same and is in the 9th decile.

I have uploaded a report (in .pdf) and our project could appear as first 
three or four pages of the report. There is also an excel (.xlsx) file 
relating to energy that could be wrangled into something emulating the EU
report. Something to discuss for tomorrow.

The above is only a suggestion. I don't mind what we do but I suppose we
have to decide on something soom.

Cheers, Kyle
